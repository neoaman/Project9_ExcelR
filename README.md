# Project9_ExcelR - The Warrenty Claim Project
During my Training period at ExcelR Solutions.
<hr>

## Project Objective:   
To predict whether the warranty claim filed by a customer is fraud or genuine.
##	Methods and Algorithms: 
Decission tree, XGBoost 0.90, CatBoost 0.19.1, Random Forest.
##	Tools and Techniques: 
Python 3.6.5, Flask (deployment), Heroku (hosting).

##	Brief description about the project: 
In this project I worked on the data of a Electronics company who sells TV and AC all over India. Using the tree-based models mentioned above I come up with more than 0.96 accuracy, so I considered them for my Model deployment, where I used the Flask module. And for showcasing my model I hosted my models using Heroku.
